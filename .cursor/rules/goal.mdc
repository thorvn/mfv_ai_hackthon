# Project goal

- Create the ruby gems that efficiently extracts and processes data from a CSV file based on a query

# Detail
- Implement a method, e.g., query_csv(file_path, query_hash), where:
  - `file_path` is a string representing the path to the CSV file.
  - `query_hash` is a hash with column headers as keys and criteria as values.
- CSV structure: [100_data.csv](mdc:data/100_data.csv)
- Query Functionality:
  - The method should parse the CSV file and return an array of hashes representing rows that match all conditions in the query_hash.
  - Return an empty array if no rows match.
- Example Usage:
```ruby
require 'gem_name'
results = GemName.query_csv('path/to/file.csv', { 'Name' => 'John', 'Age' => '30' })
```
- Error Handling: Handle errors such as file not found or incorrect query format with meaningful messages.
- Documentation: Include a README with installation instructions, usage examples, and dependencies.
- Performance: Handle large file
